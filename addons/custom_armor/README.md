# Custom Armor
Custom clone armor and equipment for Keeli Company members.

## Custom armor list
When a mission is loaded, all classes in `CfgWeapons` and `CfgVehicles` that have `BNA_KC_custom_armor_isCustom = 1` in config will be saved to a list.

This is only used in the Gonk Droids addon for the "Customize Loadout", which opens a limited ACE Arsenal with all of the items in the customs list.
