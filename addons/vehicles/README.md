# Vehicles
Vehicle systems, such as an automatic ejection sytem and crew management actions.

## Auto-Eject
When a vehicle is destroyed, any unconscious crew members or passenegers will be automatically ejected from the vehicle once the vehicle has stopped. If enabled, the crew and passengers will also recieve a brief amount of invulnerability so that they are not immediately killed. This is particular important for vehicles that are destroyed while airborne, as the crew would likely die on impact.

## Crew Spawner
Some vehicles come equipped with ACE self actions to allow the current pilot or driver of a vehicle to spawn AI crew members, as well as an action to remove all AI crew. This is mainly used in higher crew cost vehicles, such as the ARC-170, Juggernaut, etc.

## Texture Switcher
All vehicles with multiple `TextureSources` come equipped with an ACE self interaction for the current pilot or driver of a vehicle to change the textures used for the vehicle. The vehicle must be stopped in order to change the texture.
