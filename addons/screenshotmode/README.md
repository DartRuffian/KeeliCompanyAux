# Screenshot Mode
A small utility addon that toggles most UI elements, perfect for taking screenshots in missions. UI toggling is done by using a CBA "feature camera", which properly implemented mods should check for. For other mods, some specific changes may be required.

Inspired by [Gruppe Adler's screenshot mode](https://github.com/gruppe-adler/gruppe_adler_mod/tree/master/addons/screenshotMode).
