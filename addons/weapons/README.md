## EMP Weapons
EMP weapons come in two forms, as grenades or commonly referred to as "Drop Poppers" and as a vehicle weapon. EMP weapons are a special type of equipment used to disable B1 Battle droids, Droideka shields, and certain types of vehicles.

## Grenades
### Bacta Grenades
Bacta grenades are pressurized bacta in a gaseous form. When deployed, it will begin to quickly heal the physical wounds of nearby patients, as well as restoring blood, and reducing pain. There is also an alternate version of the bacta cannister capable for use in grenade launcher type weapons. It is used in the GR-20, a non-combat oriented side-arm carried by some high-ranking medical personnel.

## Attachment Swapping
Some weapons, like the DC-17M, come with different attachments for different types of weapons. These attachments will be swapped out when loading the specified type of ammunition.
