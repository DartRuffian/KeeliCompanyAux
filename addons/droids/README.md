# Droids
Combat droid functions. Most functions are based on scripts provided from [WebKnight's Droids](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2567352444), but will (eventually) be rewritten from scratch for better performance and organization.

## B1
B1 Prototype droids have slightly higher AI skill settings and move slightly faster.

## B2
Added a specific setting for the health, number of hits, for Keeli Company B2 units. Extra functionality was added to WebKnight's script in `fnc_initB2`, which fixes some of the animation issues present in WebKnight's mod.
