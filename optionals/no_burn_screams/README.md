# No Burn Screams
This is an optional addon that can be installed if desired that does not affect game play in any way. This addon removes the screaming sounds from [Burn 'Em Redux](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2915485125).

This is done by replacing the `CfgSounds` classes with empty audio files.

## Installation
To install this file, simply move the `bna_kc_no_burn_screams.pbo` file out of the optionals folder and move it to the addons folder.
